# Multiple Regression Analysis of House Sales Data in King County, Washington

**Author** Nurgul Kurbanali kyzy

### Project Overview

We will use multiple linear regression modeling for inference to study the relationship between the price and other variables present in the dataset between 20112-2105, with the hope of helping potential home buyers/seller understand the King County housing market. Thus great emphasis will be given to the coefficients of features as opposed to the overall accuracy of the model.

### Business Problem

The stakeholders of this project are a real estate agency that helps homeowners buy and/or sell homes. The business problem is to provide advice to homeowners on which aspects of the house features they should invest in, in order to increase the estimated values of their homes, and by what amount.

### Data Understanding

The dataset includes 21 assessment parameters which describes every aspect of homes in King County. These variables focus on the quality and quantity of the physical attributes of a property. The dataset and variable descriptions can be found on [here](http://localhost:8888/edit/data/column_names.md)

### Methods

We started with inspecting, and cleaning the datasets from outliers following by checking for the completeness of data and missing values. Further conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and  removed nonimportant features based on EDA. Then built multiple linear regression models to determine our strongest correlations, and used an iterative approach to our model-building. We evaluated each model  by checking multicollinearity among different features and then returned to the data to see what could to be changed, or removed to achieve a more successful model.
