## Multiple Linear Regression Analysis of King County Housing 
**Author:** Nurgul Kurbanali kyzy

### Project Overview

For the purpose of this project was used multiple linear regression modeling for inference to study the relationship between the price and other variables present in the dataset between 2014-2105 in King County with the hope of helping potential home seller understand housing market. The highly correlated predictors were dropped from the dataset. All assumptions of the linear regression were checked, and an optimal final model was achieved by keeping the most influential features only. The model accuracy assessments produced results with an adjusted R-squared value of 0.497 along with the prediction error (Mean Squared Error, MSE) of the final model was found to be (11%) by applying validation set approach. Based on the multiple linear regression model grade, view, floor levels, square footage of the living area, and basement were found to be important features that drive the overall sale price of a house in King County.

### Business Problem

The stakeholders of this project are a real estate agency that helps homeowners buy and/or sell homes. The business problem is to provide advice to homeowners on which aspects of the house features they should invest in, in order to increase the estimated values of their homes, and by what amount.

### Data Understanding

The dataset includes 21 assessment parameters which describes every aspect of homes in King County. These variables focus on the quality and quantity of the physical attributes of a property. The dataset and variable descriptions can be found on [here](https://github.com/kamalova/Multiple-Linear-Regression-King-County-Housing/blob/main/data/column_names.md)

### Methods

We started with inspecting, and cleaning the datasets from outliers following by checking for the completeness of data and missing values. Further conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and  removed nonimportant features based on EDA. Then built multiple linear regression models in OLS statsmodels to determine our strongest correlations. We evaluated each model  by checking multicollinearity among different features and then returned to the data to see what could to be changed, or removed to achieve a more successful model.
